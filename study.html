        <h1>How to Study for Quizbowl</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><h2>Choosing What Subjects to Study</h2></li>
            <h4>Quizbowl is a team game that covers tons of liberal arts subjects — most of the time, each person on a team will focus on just a few, rather than try to learn everything. There is a pre-set distribution of subjects that most tournaments adhere to, which outlines how much each broad subject area is asked about. When starting to improve, it’s helpful to narrow your efforts to just a subject or two in the distribution (like mythology or philosophy), depending on what you’re interested in.</h4>
            <li><h2>Figuring Out What Comes Next</h2></li>
            <h4>The next step after deciding on a subject is to figure out what topics within the subject are asked about. Things have a way of being asked about repeatedly in this game – arts/literature/philosophy is going to draw from their respective canons, sciences and social sciences will draw from classes, etc. There is a continual conversation that seeks to emphasize the work and experiences of underrepresented academic fields, people groups, artists, writers, and thinkers, but basically you can expect that things like Shakespeare, Plato, Renaissance art, World War II, and other “core topics” are going to come up in some way at every tournament. The easiest way to start getting a grasp of what comes up in your subjects is just to read packets and show up to practice!
                <br>
                <br>
                For most subjects and sub-subjects, looking at a syllabus or an overview Wikipedia article can be helpful just to gain schematic knowledge of a subject (e.g. “Post-colonial Africa” or “Victorian Literature” or “Art since 1900”). The goal is both to have an idea of who and what to learn about but also to learn useful reference points for contextualizing topics by time period, place/culture, movement, etc. Such reference points might include things like eras of a country’s history, different movements in literature and art, schools of thought in philosophy, and more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Being able to contextualize topics is key knowledge when it comes to answering questions by the end — the last lines of questions will often ask you to match works to their creators, creators to their countries/movements/time periods, concepts to their definitions, symbols and practices to their culture/religion, and so on.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having these sorts of ways of organizing information also helps reduce the feeling that the game is just a million individual unrelated things to learn about, which is definitely something all of us felt at one point. Don’t worry — each bit of information you learn will help you contextualize clues and topics that come up later, and you’ll start getting the lay of the land pretty quickly.</h4>
            <li><h2>Studying!</h2></li>
            <h4>It often takes some deeper study to be able to answer questions earlier on harder clues. Once you figure out what topics come up, studying them is just like learning and retaining information in any other setting. Things like making flashcards, taking notes, and writing actual questions about topics are all pretty good ways to study. Here are some thoughts on useful learning resources when it comes to studying, ordered roughly by effort involved:</h4>
                <br>
                <ul class="bullet-points">
                    <li>The questions themselves:</li><h4>It’s totally possible to improve pretty quickly by just reading questions and looking up stuff you don’t know, as well as noting down bits of information/stuff to look into more during practices. Rephrasing clues directly from questions and just putting them on flashcards is definitely something people do.</h4>
                    <li>Online resources:</li><h4>Wikipedia/Britannica and other online encyclopedia type sources are always solid, but there are also loads of podcasts and YouTube channels who make content that is useful for learning, like CrashCourse, SmartHistory, and The Partially Examined Life. Academic subreddits often have solid discussions of questions and can give good leads to further reading</h4>
                    <li>The works:</li><h4>The best way to learn things like literature and philosophy is just to engage the texts and works directly, but this is especially manageable for shorter works of literature (poems, short stories, some plays), a number of mythology primary texts, works of art and music (though this might take an extra secondary sources to distill the information into a useful form), etc.</h4>
                    <li>Flashcards:</li><h4>Using flashcards—known as “carding”—is an effective way to retain information. Some people have the ability to remember everything they read in textbooks or on Wikipedia. For the majority who cannot, carding is a strategy to retain information in your long-term memory. However, it is important to remember that carding is a tool to supplement traditional studying, not an alternative.</h4>
