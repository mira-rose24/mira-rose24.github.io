        <h1>Semester Scheduling</h1>
        <h4>There are two main types of UNC Quizbowl events: practices and tournaments.</h4>
        <h2>Practices</h2>
            <h4>UNC Quizbowl practices generally consist of the reading of ~2 Quizbowl packets per meeting. We usually split into multiple rooms based on experience level so that newer or more advanced players have the opportunity to engage with other members and packets that are at their correct level of play. This is meant to create a welcoming and accessible environment for all players, but is by no means meant to limit anyone’s experience in the club. Any and all players are allowed to play with whomever and wherever they like.
            <br>
            <br>
            Practices for the 2024 Spring semester are in Dey 305 from 7:00pm – 9:00pm.</h4>
        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
            <h4>As a club, we generally participate in 5-6 tournaments per semester at locations ranging from Maryland to South Carolina, sending 1-3 teams of four to each. We also participate in 1-2 national tournaments in the spring.
